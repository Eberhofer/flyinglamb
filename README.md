# flyinglamb
## Goals
flyinglamb is a first steps project towards a personal finance accounting system using scala akka actor and postgres wiht flyway. It's created for my personal needs and thus highly idiosyncratic and uses technologies I'm interested in - mainly scala, actors and streams. 
## Flyway
The current implementation uses flyway-sbt and migrations are triggered manually by using 'sbt flywayMigrate'.
